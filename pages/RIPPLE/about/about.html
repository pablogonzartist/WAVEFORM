   <h1> about waveforms </h1>
   <p> waveforms is an audio-visual generative project inspired by the form of sound. Garnerning visual inspiration from artists such as James Turrel, Robert Irwin, Anthony McCall and more, waveforms uses the volumetric form of the frequency spectrum to map out a songs visual structure. <br> <br>
    In electronics, acoustics, and related fields, the waveform of a signal is the shape of its graph as a function of time, independent of its time and magnitude scales and of any displacement in time. In electronics, the term is usually applied to periodically varying voltages, currents, or electromagnetic fields. For sound, the term describes a depiction of the pattern of sound pressure variation, or amplitude, in the time domain. <br> <br>
    this is precisely what waveforms is about:  <br>
    <br>
    a depiction of the pattern of sound.
